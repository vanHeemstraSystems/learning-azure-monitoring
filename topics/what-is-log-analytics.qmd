# What is Log Analytics?

![Log Analytics.](../images/what-is-log-analytics.png)

Log Analytics is a service that helps you to collect and analyze data.

- Azure Monitor stores log data in the workspace.
- Data in a workspace is organized into tables with properties you can query.

A Log Analytics workspace provides:

- A geographic location for data storage.
- Data isolation by granting different users access rights following one of our recommended design strategies.
- Scope for configuration of settings like pricing tier, retention, and data capping
