# Identify Data Sources and Access Method

![Identify Data Sources and Access Method.](../images/identify-data-sources-and-access-method.png)

- Data tiers go from Azure applications (highest tier) to Azure platform components (lowest tier).
- The method of accessing data from each tier varies - for example, installing an agent.
- Each data tier can stream to different external systems.
- Prioritize and deliberate on what data sources you need.
